'''Temperature Converter
Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a temperature and its unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
Based on the unit provided, convert the temperature to the other unit and display the result. Use a string
variable to store the unit.'''

# Greet the user and explain how to use the program.
print(Fore.YELLOW + "Hello. This program serves to convert temperature from Celsius to Farenheit, or from Farenheit to Celcius." + Style.RESET_ALL)

temp = float(input("Enter a value for the temperature: "))

# Ask user input for the unit (C or F).
unit = str(input("Enter C for Celcius or F for Farenheit: ")).strip().upper()

# Convert based on the unit; C to F or F to C, and print the respective result. If the unit is invalid, print an error message.
